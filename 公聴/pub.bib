abstract="Virtual reality (VR) provides immersive experiences through multisensory feedback, enhancing user interaction with digital environments. One key immersion aspect is texture rendering, which is commonly achieved through visual and auditory cues. Incorporating haptic feedback for realistic texture perception is a mainstream of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research activities and it remains a challenge. Most existing methods rely on hand-held devices, often limiting natural hand movements. This research explores the development and performance of a wearable device equipped with flex sensors, a Motion Processing Unit (MPU), and a coin motor, enabling texture perception at three vibration granularities. The results show that participants can distinguish various textures based on their smoothness, particularly identifying differences between them.",
