In this thesis, I proposed a time-dependent synced-rotational gain to handle multiple VR users sharing the same physical space. I compared the collision avoidance efficiency of the proposed method with the Holm's one based on the number of collisions occurring and the number of avoidance.
According to the results, the proposed method greatly reduced the amount of collisions when compared to the Holm's method.

%Future work, the users can immerse themselves in different VR experiences in the same physical space.
