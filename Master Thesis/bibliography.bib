  abstract  = {Redirected walking allows users to walk through large-scale immersive virtual environments (IVEs) while physically remaining in a reasonably small workspace by intentionally injecting scene motion into the IVE. In a constant stimuli experiment with a two-alternative-forced-choice task we have quantified how much humans can unknowingly be redirected on virtual paths which are different from the paths they actually walk. 18 subjects have been tested in four different experiments: (E1a) discrimination between virtual and physical rotation, (E1b) discrimination between two successive rotations, (E2) discrimination between virtual and physical translation, and discrimination of walking direction (E3a) without and (E3b) with start-up. In experiment E1a subjects performed rotations to which different gains have been applied, and then had to choose whether or not the visually perceived rotation was greater than the physical rotation. In experiment E1b subjects discriminated between two successive rotations where different gains have been applied to the physical rotation. In experiment E2 subjects chose if they thought that the physical walk was longer than the visually perceived scaled travel distance. In experiment E3a subjects walked a straight path in the IVE which was physically bent to the left or to the right, and they estimate the direction of the curvature. In experiment E3a the gain was applied immediately, whereas the gain was applied after a start-up of two meters in experiment E3b. Our results show that users can be turned physically about 68\% more or 10\% less than the perceived virtual rotation, distances can be up- or down-scaled by 22\%, and users can be redirected on an circular arc with a radius greater than 24 meters while they believe they are walking straight.},

We quantify to what degreeusers can unknowingly be redirected in order to guidethem through VEs in which virtual paths differ fromthe physical paths. We further introduce the concept ofdynamic passive haptics by which any number of virtualobjects can be mapped to real physical proxy propshaving similar haptic properties (i. e., size, shape, andsurface structure), such that the user can sense thesevirtual objects by touching their real world counterparts.Dynamic passive haptics provides the user withthe illusion of interacting with a desired virtual objectby redirecting her to the corresponding proxy prop.We describe the concepts of generic redirected walkingand dynamic passive haptics and present experimentsin which we have evaluated these concepts. Furthermore,we discuss implications that have been derivedfrom a user study, and we present approachesthat derive physical paths which may vary from thevirtual counterparts.},

  abstract  = {Virtual Environments presented through head-mounted displays (HMDs) are often explored on foot. Exploration on foot is useful since the afferent and efferent cues of physical locomotion aid spatial awareness. However, the size of the virtual environment that can be explored on foot is limited to the dimensions of the tracking space of the HMD unless other strategies are used. This paper presents a system for exploring a large virtual environment on foot when the size of the physical surroundings is small by leveraging people's natural ability to spatially update. This paper presents three methods of "resetting" users when they reach the physical limits of the HMD tracking system. Resetting involves manipulating the users' location in physical space to move them out of the path of the physical obstruction while maintaining their spatial awareness of the virtual space.},

abstract = {Vibrotactile actuation is mainly used to deliver buzzing sensations. But if vibrotactile actuation is tightly coupled to users' actions, it can be used to create much richer haptic experiences. It is not well understood, however, how this coupling should be done or which vibrotactile parameters create which experiences. To investigate how actuation parameters relate to haptic experiences, we built a physical slider with minimal native friction, a vibrotactile actuator and an integrated position sensor. By vibrating the slider as it is moved, we create an experience of texture between the sliding element and its track. We conducted a magnitude estimation experiment to map how granularity, amplitude and timbre relate to the experiences of roughness, adhesiveness, sharpness and bumpiness. We found that amplitude influences the strength of the perceived texture, while variations in granularity and timbre create distinct experiences. Our study underlines the importance of action in haptic perception and suggests strategies for deploying such tightly coupled feedback in everyday devices.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a scale construction and its initial test as a step towards a standardized measure of the illusion of virtual body ownership (IVBO) in virtual simulations. The IVBO describes the effect of users partly or fully perceiving a virtual body as their own. We analyzed components for a scale we call "Alpha IVBO" by using data from a fake mirror scenario study. Users saw their movements mapped in real-time to a virtual avatar rendered on 3D display placed in front of them. The principal component analysis of our sample data resulted in three factors: "acceptance", "control" and "change".},
