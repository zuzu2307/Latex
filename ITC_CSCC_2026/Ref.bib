abstract = {Haptic interactions between human and machines are essential for information acquisition and object manipulation. In virtual reality (VR) system, the haptic sensing device can gather information to construct virtual elements, while the haptic feedback part can transfer feedbacks to human with virtual tactile sensation. Therefore, exploring high-performance haptic sensing and feedback interface imparts closed-loop haptic interaction to VR system. This review summarizes state-of-the-art VR-related haptic sensing and feedback techniques based on the hardware parts. For the haptic sensor, we focus on mechanism scope (piezoresistive, capacitive, piezoelectric, and triboelectric) and introduce force sensor, gesture translation, and touch identification in the functional view. In terms of the haptic feedbacks, methodologies including mechanical, electrical, and elastic actuators are surveyed. In addition, the interactive application of virtual control, immersive entertainment, and medical rehabilitation is also summarized. The challenges of virtual haptic interactions are given including the accuracy, durability, and technical conflicts of the sensing devices, bottlenecks of various feedbacks, as well as the closed-loop interaction system. Besides, the prospects are outlined in artificial intelligence of things, wise information technology of medicine, and multimedia VR areas.}

    abstract = {This paper presents a quantitative characterization of the instability that a human user often experiences while interacting with a virtual textured surface rendered with a force-reflecting haptic interface. First, we quantified the degree of stability/ instability during haptic texture rendering through psychophysical experiments. The stiffness of the virtual textured surface upon detection of instability was measured under a variety of experimental conditions using two texture rendering methods, two exploration modes, and various texture model parameters. We found that the range of stiffness values for stable texture rendering was quite limited. Second, we investigated the attributes of the proximal stimuli experienced by a human hand while exploring the virtual textured surface in an attempt to identify the sources of perceived instability. Position, force, and acceleration were measured and then analyzed in the frequency domain. The results were characterized by sensation levels in terms of spectral intensity in dB relative to the human detection threshold at the same frequency. We found that the spectral bands responsible for texture and instability perception were well separated in frequency such that they excited different mechanoreceptors and were, therefore, perceptually distinctive. Furthermore, we identified the high-frequency dynamics of the device to be a likely source of perceived instability. Our work has implications for displaying textured surfaces through a force feedback device in a virtual environment.},

    abstract = {The effectiveness of virtual environments (VEs) has often been linked to the sense of presence reported by users of those VEs. (Presence is defined as the subjective experience of being in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another.) We believe that presence is a normal awareness phenomenon that requires directed attention and is based in the interaction between sensory stimulation, environmental factors that encourage involvement and enable immersion, and internal tendencies to become involved. Factors believed to underlie presence were described in the premier issue of Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments. We used these factors and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive tendencies questionnaire (ITQ) to measure differences in the tendencies of individuals to experience presence. These questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among reported presence and other research variables. Combined results from four experiments lead to the following conclusions: the PQ and ITQ are internally consistent measures with high reliability;there is a weak but consistent positive relation between presence and task performance in VEs;individual tendencies as measured by the ITQ predict presence as measured by the PQ; andindividuals who report more simulator sickness symptoms in VE report less presence than those who report fewer symptoms.},
