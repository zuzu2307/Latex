abstract = "The Fifth Generation (5G) network is expected to be flexible to satisfy user requirements and the Software-Defined Network (SDN) with Network Slicing is a good approach for admission control. There are different challenges of 5G networks such as: improved spectrum efficiency, reduced latency, low consumption, high data rate, capacity and throughput improvement. To deal with these challenges, we propose an Integrated Fuzzy-based Admission Control System (IFACS) for 5G Wireless Networks. We consider 4 input parameters: Quality of Service (QoS), Slice Priority (SP), User Request Delay Time (URDT) and Slice Overloading Cost (SOC). From simulation results, we conclude that the considered parameters have different effects on the acceptance decision. When QoS, SP, URDT parameters are increased, the AD value is increased. But, when the SOC parameter is increased, the AD value is decreased. When the QoS increases 20%, the AD is increased 20% when SP value is 0.5, SOC value is 0.3 and the URDT value is 0.5. But, when the SOC value changes 40%, the AD is decreased by 20% when the URDT value is 0.5."

abstract="This chapter presents some of the recent modified variants of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The main focus is on the design and implementation of the modified PSO based on diversity, Mutation, Crossover and efficient Initialization using different distributions and Low-discrepancy sequences. These algorithms are applied to various benchmark problems including unimodal, multimodal, noisy functions and real life applications in engineering fields. The effectiveness of the algorithms is discussed.",
