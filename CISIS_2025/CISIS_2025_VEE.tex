\abstract{
Virtual reality (VR) provides immersive experiences through multisensory feedback, enhancing user interaction with digital environments. One key immersion aspect is texture rendering, which is commonly achieved through visual and auditory cues. Incorporating haptic feedback for realistic texture perception is a mainstream of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research activities and it remains a challenge. Most existing methods rely on hand-held devices, often limiting natural hand movements. This research explores the development and performance of a wearable device equipped with flex sensors, a Motion Processing Unit (MPU), and a coin motor, enabling texture perception at three vibration granularities. The results show that participants can distinguish various textures based on their smoothness, particularly identifying differences between them.

\section{Introduction}
Virtual reality has evolved into a powerful tool for immersive experiences across diverse domains such as gaming, training, and therapy \cite{slater2016enhancing}. By integrating visual, auditory, and interactive components, VR environments offer users the sensation of presence, significantly enhancing engagement and realism \cite{biocca2013communication}. Advances in display technologies, motion tracking systems, and spatial audio have greatly improved immersion; however, realistic tactile perception remains a significant challenge, constraining overall sensory fidelity in VR applications.

Haptic feedback is essential in bridging this sensory gap, as it introduces tactile stimuli that simulate real-world touch sensations \cite{culbertson2018haptics}. Various haptic devices, including vibrotactile actuators, force-feedback systems, and wearable gloves, have been developed to enhance tactile realism. Although handheld controllers are commonly used, they often restrict natural hand movements, negatively affecting immersion. Wearable solutions offer a promising alternative by enabling direct and intuitive hand interactions with virtual objects \cite{pacchierotti2017wearable}. Nonetheless, designing lightweight, responsive, and versatile wearable haptic systems remains an open challenge within HCI research.

To address these limitations, we propose a custom wearable glove equipped with flex sensors, MPU, and a coin motor for providing nuanced haptic feedback. Our glove enhances virtual texture perception by modulating vibration frequencies across three distinct granularities, selected based on their demonstrated influence on perceived texture realism \cite{strohmeier2017generating,bensmaia2005vibrations}. This paper's contributions include the development of a lightweight and responsive wearable device and the empirical evaluation of users' tactile perception of texture granularity, thereby advancing the realism and immersion of VR haptic feedback systems.

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:nssdn}
Recent advancements in haptic feedback systems have emphasized simulating realistic texture granularity using techniques like Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and advanced tactile technologies. Bach et al. \cite{bach2023enhanced} notably enhanced tactile experiences using Pb(Zr,Ti)O₃ thin films on German silver foils, contributing to more precise texture sensations in microsystem technologies. Otake et al. \cite{otake2022vibrotactile} explored combining vibrotactile and electrostatic-friction stimuli, significantly improving texture realism for touch-panel applications.

Machine learning approaches also gained prominence for generating realistic tactile feedback. Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2022texsensegan} developed TexSenseGAN, leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to optimize vibrotactile feedback based on user input, enhancing texture realism intuitively. Moreover, Strohmeier and Hornbæk \cite{strohmeier2017generating} examined how parameters like granularity, amplitude, and timbre affect perceived haptic textures, identifying granularity as particularly influential for users' perception of bumpiness and smoothness.

PWM technology, frequently integrated into these systems, provides dynamic adjustments of vibration intensity and frequency, enabling precise simulations of texture granularity. This capability facilitates generating tactile sensations ranging from smooth surfaces to coarse textures. However, despite significant progress, existing systems often fail to offer fully intuitive and unrestricted hand interactions due to physical constraints or limited responsiveness.

Our research addresses this gap by employing PWM for precise granularity simulation in wearable haptic devices, focusing explicitly on texture perception within virtual environments. By providing dynamic, responsive, and intuitive tactile feedback, our approach enhances user immersion and interaction realism in VR applications.

\section{Haptic Data Glove}\label{sec:shd}
Our proposed wearable haptic device addresses current limitations in natural hand interaction, enhancing texture perception in virtual environments. The system comprises three primary modules: an ESP32 microcontroller, sensory components (flex sensors and IMU), and a coin vibration motor actuator. The detailed architecture of the system is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:system_diagram}.

\begin{figure}\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figure/system diagram.png}%imagine Avation
	\caption{System architecture of the wearable haptic glove, showing integration between Unity, ESP32, and hardware components.}\label{fig:system_diagram}
\end{figure}
\textbf{ESP32 Microcontroller:}  
The ESP32 functions as the core processing unit, managing sensor data acquisition, real-time data processing, actuator control, and wireless communication. It employs Serial Communication to ensure continuous bidirectional data exchange with Unity, maintaining synchronization of haptic stimuli and sensor readings.

\textbf{Flex Sensors (x5):}  
Five resistive flex sensors, positioned along each finger of the glove, measure finger bending. These sensors deliver real-time analog signals corresponding to finger positions, enabling precise gesture recognition and accurate hand tracking.

\textbf{Inertial Measurement Unit (MPU-6050):}  
An MPU-6050 sensor captures spatial orientation, acceleration, and angular velocity data of hand movements. Integration of IMU measurements enhances spatial coherence between real and virtual hand positions, significantly improving immersive realism and spatial fidelity.

\textbf{Coin Vibration Motor:}  
A coin-type vibration motor generates controlled tactile feedback, utilizing Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to replicate varying granularities in virtual textures. PWM modulation enables dynamic adjustment of vibration intensity and frequency, simulating realistic sensations from smooth to coarse surfaces. The device provides three distinct haptic feedback, systematically evaluating users' tactile perception sensitivity as recommended by prior research~\cite{strohmeier2017generating, bensmaia2005vibrations}.

The integration of these components into the wearable device is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:glove_1}.

\end{figure}

This integrated approach facilitates intuitive interactions in virtual environments, enabling natural hand movements combined with realistic tactile sensations. The selected components directly address limitations noted in existing literature, achieving a lightweight, responsive design with nuanced texture rendering.

\section{Proposed Fuzzy-based System}\label{sec:proposed}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:5GHO} is provided the overview of proposed system. Each evolved Base Station (eBS) operates under the control of SDN controller, which is responsible for issuing control commands that govern communication and data transmission between the eBS and User Equipment (UE). The SDN controller plays a pivotal role in orchestrating the network, ensuring dynamic resource allocation, and optimizing traffic flow in real time. The SDN controller acts as a centralized control unit, bridging communication between the eBS and the 5G core network. It coordinates with the core network elements, such as the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) and the User Plane Function (UPF), to ensure a seamless HO process and maintain uninterrupted connectivity and efficient resource management throughout the network.

Each eBS supports multiple NSs, where each slice is dedicated to specific types of applications or services, such as enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC), or Massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC). This slicing capability enables the network to deal with diverse requirements simultaneously, enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of the 5G infrastructure.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:FLC1}, we show the proposed system structure. We describe in following the considered system parameters.

\textbf{Slice Load (SL):} When the SL increases, the slice becomes more congested, meaning that its resources are under heavy demand. This can lead to performance degradation and the system should make
HO to a less loaded slice.  Higher SL increases the HO probability because the load should be balanced 
to different slices.  

\textbf{Slice Stability (SS):} The SS refers to the capacity of a network slice to sustain consistent performance and QoS over the time, even during fluctuating network conditions or varying user demands. A NS with high stability guarantees reliable communication services and maintains steady performance, contributing to an enhanced user experience. On the other hand, if the SS is low, it indicates potential degradation in QoS. In such cases, the system initiates the HO to a more stable slice to ensure uninterrupted service and better performance.

\textbf{Slice Delay (SD):} The SD represents the latency experienced within a NS, typically resulting from data packet queuing and underlying network delays. A long SD can greatly affect the QoS. Such delays can lead to issues like lag, jitter, and disruptions, which are especially problematic for services that rely on immediate data transmission and low-latency performance.

\textbf{Slice Monetary Cost (SMC):} The SMC refers to the financial costs associated with deploying and maintaining NSs in 5G or B5G networks. Different slices might offer the same services at different costs due to variations in how resources are allocated, managed and optimized. The SMC can vary depending on the efficiency of the network infrastructure associated with each slice~\cite{walia2021virtualization}. The inter-slice HO possibility will be higher for slices with high monetary cost. 

\textbf{Handover Decision (HD):} The HD parameter is evaluated using the abovementioned four input parameters to determine whether to initiate or not the HO procedure.

In Table \ref{tab:Parameter}, we present both the input parameters (SL, SS, SD, SMC) and the output parameter (HD) along with their associated term sets. While in Fig.~\ref{fig:MB}, we show the memership functions. For instance, SL is categorized as Light Load, Medium Load or Heavy Load, while SS is classified as Unstable, Moderately Stable or Stable. The output parameter (HD), is divided into seven levels, ranging from HD1 to HD7. To enable real-time operation, we utilize triangular and trapezoidal membership functions due to their simplicity and computational efficiency. The Fuzzy Rule Base (FRB) is developed using a set of 135 rules structured as "IF [condition] THEN [control action]". This comprehensive rule base allows the system to assess various combinations of input parameters and adaptively make HD decision.

\section{Simulation Results}\label{sec:sim-results}
We present the simulation results of our proposed system in Fig.~\ref{fig:SLL}, Fig.~\ref{fig:SLM}, and Fig.~\ref{fig:SLH} for different SL values 10\%, 50\%, and 90\%, respectively. The output parameter, denoted as HD, is analyzed in relation to four input parameters: SL, SS, SD, and SMC. 

 
 %%%%% SL - 10% %%%%%%%%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:SLL}~(a), SL value is 10\% and SS value is 10\%. For SD 90\%, we changed the SMC values from 10\% to 50\% and from 50\% to 90\%. We observed that the HD values increased by 10\% in both cases. Considering other SD values less than 50\%, the HD value is less than 0.5. This means that for small SL, moderate SD, and small SS, the HO process will not be carried out. However, when the serving slice has a very high delay, unstable service, and higher cost, the inter-slice handover is needed. In Fig.~\ref{fig:SLL}~(b), the SS value is increasing to 90\%, which shows that the serving slice is more stable than Fig.~\ref{fig:SLL}~(a). All HD values are below 0.5, indicating that the likelihood of a HO is low regardless of the values of other parameters.

 %%%%% SL - 50% %%%%%%%%
For SS 10\%, we increased the SL value from 10\% to 50\% (see Fig.~\ref{fig:SLL}~(a)) and then
to 90\% (see Fig.~\ref{fig:SLM}~(a)). In these cases, when SD is 70\% and SMC is 50\%, the HD is increasing by 20\%. In Fig.~\ref{fig:SLM}~(a), we see that when the SD values increase from 10\% to 90\%, the HD values also increase. When the SMC value is 50\% and for SD more than 50\%, all  HD values are higher than 0.5. This means that for these cases the HO procees is needed. Comparing Fig.~\ref{fig:SLM}~(b) with Fig.~\ref{fig:SLL}~(b), we see that the increase of SL increases the HO possibility. 
  
 %%%%% SL - 90% %%%%%%%%
When the SL value is increased to 90\% in Fig.~\ref{fig:SLH}~(a) and SS value is 10\%, the HD values are significantly higher compared with other scenarios. All HD values are higher than 0.5. This is because the serving slice has a heavy load and an unstable service resulting in inter-slice HO. However, when the SS value is increased from 10\% to 90\%, the HD values are decreasing. For SMC values below 50\% and SD values ranging from 10\% to 50\%, the HD values are below 0.5. Thus, the HO process is not needed.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we proposed a Fuzzy-based HO system for 5G/B5G wireless networks considering four parameters: SL, SS, SD and SMC, which is a new parameter. The simulation results indicate that these parameters have different effects on the HD. When SL, SD and SMC increase, the probability of the HD is increased. However, the SS reduces the HD probability and the user remains in the serving slice.

In future work, we plan to incorporate additional parameters and perform comprehensive simulations to assess the effectiveness of the proposed system.
